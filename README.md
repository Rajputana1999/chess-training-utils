# chess-training-utils
Utilities for improving Chess Visualization.
<br>
Compile the utilites ( for now chess_color.cpp ) with
<br>    <code> g++ utility.cpp -o utility </code>
<br> and paste them in your /usr/local/bin/ with
<br>    <code> sudo mv utility /usr/local/bin/ </code>
<br>
now you can directly call them with your terminal with the name of the utility.
